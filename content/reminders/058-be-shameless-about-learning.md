  Reminder to myself:

  Be shameless about learning from other people.

  Doesn’t matter the person’s age, gender, ethnicity, money, intelligence,
  talents, physical appearance, whatever.

  If someone else knows something that you don’t then learn it from them
  and make your life better.

# Reminder to myself

Be shameless about learning from other people.  
Age, background, money, intelligence, appearance... none of it matters.

If someone knows something you don’t, learn it from them.  
Steal the insight. Upgrade your life.
