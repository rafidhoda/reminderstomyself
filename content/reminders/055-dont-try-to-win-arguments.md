  Reminder to myself:

  Arguments are usually won by those that can speak in a more eloquent way.

  Don't be fooled by this.

  In fact, don't even try to win arguments.

  It's not worth it.

  You literally don't get anything for it, except for wasted time.

# Reminder to myself

Arguments are usually won by the person who speaks more eloquently.  
Don’t be fooled by that.

Don’t try to win arguments.  
It’s not worth it.  
All you get is wasted time.
