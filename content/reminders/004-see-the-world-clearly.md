  Your ego prevents you from seeing the world, the way it actually is.
  
  Wanna know more about how the world actually is?
  
  Be curious → Ask questions
  
  When people answer, try to really listen, rather than making everything about yourself.
  
  Repeat.

# Reminder to myself

Your ego distorts your view of the world.

If you want to see things as they really are, be curious. Ask questions.

And when people answer, try to really listen.
Avoid making everything about yourself.
