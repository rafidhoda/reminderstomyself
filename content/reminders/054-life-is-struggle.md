  Reminder to myself:

  Life is struggle.

  As you grow you will solve current problems, but those problems will be replaced with new problems.

  Accept this and try to enjoy the ride as much as you can :)

# Reminder to myself

Life is struggle.  
As you grow, you’ll solve the problems you have now, but new ones will replace them.

Accept this, and try to enjoy the ride as much as you can.
