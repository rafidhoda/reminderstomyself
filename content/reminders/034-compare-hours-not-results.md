  Comparing yourself to your peers?

  and feeling that you're far behind?

  Comparing yourself to others is not a good idea

  But if you're gonna compare something

  Make it fair:

  Compare the number of hours spent on the thing

  - How many hours have they put in during their lifetime?
  - How many have you?

# Reminder to myself

Comparing yourself to your peers and feeling behind?

Comparing yourself to others is never a good idea.  
But if you're going to compare something, make it fair.

Compare the number of hours put into the thing.

How many hours have they put in over their lifetime?  
How many have you?
