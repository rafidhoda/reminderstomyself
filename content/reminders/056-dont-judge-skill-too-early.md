  Reminder to myself:

  New rule.

  You're not allowed to judge your ability to do something before you've done that thing for at least a year.

  Try it out for a year, then decide if you want to label yourself as "good" or "bad" at it.

# Reminder to myself

New rule.  
You’re not allowed to judge your ability at something until you’ve done it for at least a year.

Do it for a year.  
Then decide if you’re “good” or “bad” at it.
