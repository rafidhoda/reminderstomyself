  Reminder to myself:

  In your pursuit of success make sure to not imprison yourself.

  If you get what you always wanted but you are miserable as a result,
  then you lost.

  True success is freedom to choose how and with whom you get to spend
  your limited time on this earth.

# Reminder to myself

In your pursuit of success, make sure you do not trap yourself.  
If you get everything you thought you wanted but end up miserable, that is not success.

Real success is freedom.  
Freedom to choose how you spend your time  
and who you spend it with.
