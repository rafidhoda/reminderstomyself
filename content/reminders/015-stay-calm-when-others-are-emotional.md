  Just because someone is getting emotional while talking to you doesn’t mean that you also need to become emotional.

  Their emotional response is probably due to a bunch of stuff that happened in the past, that may or may not, be related to you.

# Reminder to myself

Just because someone gets emotional while talking to you does not mean you also need to get emotional.

Their reaction is usually shaped by things that happened in the past,  
things that may or may not be related to you.
