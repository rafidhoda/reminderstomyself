  If someone tells you something

  and your response is always a:

  Worrying and explosive response

  Then people will stop telling you

  Important things

  Not because they want to lie to you

  But because they can’t deal

  with your default response

# Reminder to myself

If your default response is worry or explosions  
people will eventually stop telling you important things.

Not because they want to hide anything  
but because they can’t handle your reaction.
