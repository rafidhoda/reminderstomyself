  When someone tells you:

  "I don’t believe you can do that"

  Just remember

  They are actually saying:

  "I don’t believe I can do that"

  Don’t get angry or frustrated :)

# Reminder to myself

When someone says  
"I don’t believe you can do that"

What they really mean is  
"I don’t believe I can do that"

So don’t get angry.  
Don’t get frustrated.  
Their limits are not your limits.
