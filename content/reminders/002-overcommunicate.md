  It is always better to over-communicate than under-communicate.

  Things that are obvious to you may not be obvious to others, and vice versa.

  Don’t make assumptions, it leads to miscommunication.

  And remember:

# Reminder to myself

It’s almost always better to over-communicate than under-communicate.

What’s obvious to you may not be obvious to others, and vice versa.

Avoid assumptions. They are the root of most miscommunication.
