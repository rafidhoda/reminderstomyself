  Day A:
  10 hours of work → Didn't feel productive today

  Day B:
  7 hours of work → Felt very productive today

  The world is a non-linear system.

  The change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input.

  Think long-term and enjoy the journey.

# Reminder to myself

Day A:  
10 hours of work → Didn’t feel productive.

Day B:  
7 hours of work → Felt very productive.

Productivity is a **non-linear system**.  
Effort doesn’t map directly to results.

Focus on the long term, and enjoy the journey.
