  You are good enough. There is nothing you must do in the future to prove yourself.

  You have done things in the past that you regret. Everyone does. Forgive yourself, learn from your mistakes and keep on moving.

  You have one life. Have as much fun as you can

# Reminder to myself

You are good enough. You don’t need to achieve anything in the future to prove your worth.

You’ve done things you regret. Everyone has.  
Forgive yourself, learn from them, and keep going.

You get one life.  
Have as much fun as you can.
