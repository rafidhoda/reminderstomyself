  Trying to explain something to someone?

  It's very very difficult

  Because there are so many things in the brain

  that have to line up exactly

  for someone to get what you're talking about

  So a better approach I've found

  Is to just ask questions

  Rather than explain

# Reminder to myself

Trying to explain something to someone?

It's hard. Really hard.  
There are so many things in the brain that need to line up for someone to truly understand what you mean.

A better approach?  
Ask questions instead of explaining.
