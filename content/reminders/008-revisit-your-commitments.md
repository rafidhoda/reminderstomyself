  Which things did you commit to a long time ago that you are still doing?

  Even if you don’t believe in it anymore? Even if it’s no longer fun? Even if you’re no longer learning?

  Make sure to ask yourself this every once in a while and adjust accordingly.

# Reminder to myself

Which things did you commit to a long time ago that you are still doing?

Even if you don’t believe in it anymore?  
Even if it’s no longer fun?  
Even if you’re no longer learning?

Ask yourself this every once in a while and adjust accordingly.
