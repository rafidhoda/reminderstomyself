# Reminder to myself

Exponential growth is real. It’s one of the fundamental laws of the universe.

So what does that mean for you?

If you consistently put in just a bit more effort than most people — in the right direction —  
that small edge compounds.

Give it 10 years.

The rewards are not a little better.  
They’re massively better.  
Orders of magnitude better.
