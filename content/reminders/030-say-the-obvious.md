  Don't not say something just because it seems obvious to you. Every human being has a different brain and life experience.

  What's obvious to you can be very profound and insightful to another person.

# Reminder to myself

Say things even if they feel obvious to you.  
Everyone has a different brain and a different life experience.

What feels obvious to you might be profound or eye-opening to someone else.
