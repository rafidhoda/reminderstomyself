  Ideas should be worked on when the initial excitement of getting the idea has completely worn off.

  In most cases, you'll find that you don't even want to spend time on the idea that made you so excited just a little while ago.

# Reminder to myself

Work on an idea only after the initial excitement fades.

In most cases, once the hype dies down, you will not even want to work on the idea that felt exciting just a little while ago.

That alone tells you whether it is worth pursuing.
