  If you improve just 0.1% every day for 10 years you'll be:

  38 times better than when you started.

  Now, if you improved 0.2% every day for those 10 years in the end you'll be:

  1 469 better than when you started.

Tiny daily improvements add up in ways that feel impossible in the moment.

If you get just a little better every day the compounding will take care of the rest.
