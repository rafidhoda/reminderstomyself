  Having a passion for one thing is good.

  But what is even better is to have a passion for learning.

  Having a passion for learning new things will lead you to making connections between things you thought were unrelated.

  Doing this consistently over time makes the brain a learning machine.

  The deeper you go into things, the more you'll realise how everything is related to everything else.

  Ultimately this is the more fun way to live life.

  You'll never be bored!

# Reminder to myself

Having a passion for one thing is good.

But having a passion for learning is even better.

When you stay curious, you start seeing connections between things you once thought were unrelated.

Do this consistently and your brain becomes a learning machine.

The deeper you go, the more you realise how everything connects.

It’s a more fun way to live.  
You’ll never be bored.
