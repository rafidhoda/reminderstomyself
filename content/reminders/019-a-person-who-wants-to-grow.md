  There is nothing more beautiful than a person who wishes to grow.

  A person who wishes to learn from their past mistakes and try their best not to make the same mistakes again.

  But is not afraid to make new mistakes.

  Because that's the only way to grow.

# Reminder to myself

There is nothing more beautiful than a person who wants to grow.

Someone who learns from their past mistakes and tries not to repeat them.  
Someone who is not afraid to make new mistakes.

Because that is the only way to grow.
