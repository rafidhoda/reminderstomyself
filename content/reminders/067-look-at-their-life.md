  Before taking someone’s advice, look at their life.

  Are they the type of person you want to be more like?

  That’ll give you a lot more useful information than any specific advice they give you.

# Reminder to myself

Before you take someone's advice, look at their life.

Are they living in a way you want to move toward?

That will tell you more than the advice itself.
