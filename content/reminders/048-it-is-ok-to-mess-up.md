  It’s ok to fuck up.

  Everyone does that all the time.

  It’s the only way you know to live.

  Just remember that when you do fuck up that you make it right with all
  the people that were affected as a result of your fuck up.

  Start with apologizing.

# Reminder to myself

It is ok to mess up.  
Everyone does. It is part of being alive.

Just make it right with the people who were affected.  
Start by apologizing.
