  There are certain narratives that live inside your brain about certain people.

  These narratives are so strong that even if new data comes to light that oppose the existing narrative, your brain will force it to support the narrative.

There are certain narratives that live in your mind about certain people.

These narratives can be so strong that even when new information appears that contradicts them,  
your mind will still try to force the new information to fit the narrative.
