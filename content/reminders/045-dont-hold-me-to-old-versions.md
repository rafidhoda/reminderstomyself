  "But you said 10 years ago that..."

  Wait!

  You’re gonna hold to what I said to you

  10 years ago?

  Please hold me to what I told you yesterday

  Because I’m a completely different person now

  Compared to 10 years ago

# Reminder to myself

"But you said that 10 years ago..."

Wait.

You’re really going to hold me to something I said  
10 years ago?

Hold me to what I said yesterday.  
Not to who I was a decade ago.

Because I’m a completely different person now.
