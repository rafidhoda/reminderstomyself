  No matter how many of your current desires come true → Your baseline happiness and mood will not change much

  The attainment of a desire will make you excited for a short amount of time and then things will go back to baseline pretty fast.

# Reminder to myself

No matter how many of your desires come true, your baseline happiness will not change much.

When you get what you want, you feel excited for a short time.  
Then things go back to baseline pretty fast.
