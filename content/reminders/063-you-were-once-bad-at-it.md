  Reminder to myself:

  Everything you're good at now, you were once shitty at.

  Don't forget this fact as you continue to age.

# Reminder to myself

Everything you're good at now was something you were once bad at.

Remember that as you get older.  
Growth never stops, and every skill begins at zero.
