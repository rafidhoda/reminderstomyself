  Do. Then talk.

  Don’t:
  Talk. Then Do.

  The chances of you actually doing a thing you said you will do decreases if you talk about it first.

# Reminder to myself

Do. Then talk.

Don’t:  
Talk. Then do.

When you talk about something before you do it,  
the chances of actually doing it go down.
