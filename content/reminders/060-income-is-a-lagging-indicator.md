  Reminder to myself:

  Don’t worry at all about your salary amount.

  Especially don’t compare with others.

  Your income is a lagging indicator of what you’ve spent the last 5 years doing.

# Reminder to myself

Do not worry about your salary.  
And do not compare it with anyone else.

Your income is a lagging indicator  
of what you have been doing for the last five years.
