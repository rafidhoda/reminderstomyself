  Reminder to myself:

  After completing a project, make sure to document it in some way.

  However small.

  This way, in 10 years when your brain goes

  "What do I have to show for that project I worked on?"

  you'll have that thing to look back at.

# Reminder to myself

After you finish a project, document it.  
It can be tiny. It can be rough. Just capture something.

Because in 10 years, when your brain goes  
“What do I have to show for that thing I worked on?”  
you’ll have something real to look back at.
