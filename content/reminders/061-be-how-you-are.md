  Reminder to myself:

  Human beings mirror each other unconsciously.

  But remember, if you're sad and you're talking to a happy person you don't need to fake being happy.

  Also, if you're happy and you're talking to a sad person you don't need to fake being sad.

# Reminder to myself

People mirror each other without realizing it.

But remember this:  
If you are sad and talking to a happy person, you do not need to pretend to be happy.  
And if you are happy and talking to a sad person, you do not need to pretend to be sad.

Just be how you are.
