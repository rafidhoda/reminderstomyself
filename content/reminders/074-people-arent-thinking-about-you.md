  It’s tempting to think “what will other people think?” every now and then.

  But the reality is that everyone is self obsessed.

  Just think about, how much time do you spend thinking about others?

# Reminder to myself

It’s easy to wonder what other people think of you.

But the truth is that most people are too busy thinking about themselves.

Ask yourself: how much time do you really spend thinking about others?

Not much.  
So stop worrying so much about what they think.
