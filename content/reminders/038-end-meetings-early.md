  Remember

  A 45 min meeting

  Can end after 11 mins

  If there is nothing more to discuss

  There is no rule that says

  you HAVE to go on for 45 mins

# Reminder to myself

Remember this:

A 45 minute meeting can end after 11 minutes.  
If there is nothing more to talk about, you can stop.  
There is no rule that says you must keep going just because the calendar said 45 minutes.
